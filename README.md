The Forgotten Tibia
===============

The Forgotten Tibia is a free and open-source MMORPG written in C++ and LUA.  
It is a fork from the [The Forgotten Server 1.3](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/) ([3b63f65](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/commit/3b63f65)), [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/) ([07b4b78](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/commit/07b4b78)) and [ZnoteAAC](https://github.com/Znote/ZnoteAAC) ([effe5d2](https://github.com/Znote/ZnoteAAC/commit/effe5d2)) projects.

## What makes it different from Tibia / The Forgotten Server 1.3?

- ### There are no vocations  
Everyone starts as a normal human being with points to be distributed among the skills.

- ### There is no skill training  
Each level you advance you receive points to be distributed among the skills. The more levels you get, less points you receive.

- ### All clubs, swords and axes damage are based on Strenght

- ### You can use two one-handed weapons at the same time  
Attack speed will increase and each weapon damage will decrease.

- ### Distance weapons damage are based on Strenght and/or Dexterity

- ### Two-handed melee weapons can do critical hit and bleeding effect

- ### You don't need to open monsters to pickup loots while hunting  
Just need to select the item you want to loot and add to / remove from your loot list.

- ### You don't need to refill ammunition when hunting with arrows or bolts  
Just need to use a quiver/container on the arrow slot.

- ### Wands and Rods maximum damage can be increased
When you advance your intelligence skill you increase your wand's maximum damage. Same thing works for faith and rods.

- ### Access to spells and runes are based on Faith and Intelligence  
There is no level or vocation requirement for spells and runes. The more you raise faith and intelligence, more spells and runes you get.

- ### Runes damage are based on Magic

- ### The screen has one more tile  
It was added one more square meter to the screen.

- ### You can set a title to your character
If you have the requirements you can be a mage, a supporter, a knight or a ranger.
